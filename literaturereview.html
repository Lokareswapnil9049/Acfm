        <h3>1.Assessment of selected parameters of automatic and  Conventional equipment used in cattle feeding.</h3>
        <p>A cattle farming is a very important sector of agriculture. In the Czech Republic, both breeds with ‘combined useful’ as well as ‘meat cattle’ are breeding, but especially  
            ‘dairy cattle’ breeds. Providing feed at the right time, in required quantity and quality is the basis of successful breeding, especially in breeding dairy cows. Automatic 
            systems are present in almost all sectors of human activity, and livestock production is no exception. Fully automatic feeding systems for pigs or poultry are already in use. 
            The process of milking cattle using automated milking systems is also sufficiently mastered. An interesting trend is the installation of automated feeding systems for cattle 
            feeding. They are stationary lines that perform the following operations: they dose the individual components of the feed mixture, mix the feed mixture and distribute it to 
            the relevant feed places. All these activities are usually done without the presence of a person. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the benefits of an automatic feed 
            system with regard to the conventional feed system through a mobile feed car.

        <h3>2.Automatic feeding systems for cattle – a study of the energy consumption of the techniques. </h3> 
        <p>
            This paper talks about Automatic feeding systems (AFS) for dairy cows and fattening bulls gain in importance. One main reason is to reduce labour time and workload. But increasing
            automation and mechanization can lead to rising energy consumption and costs. Therefore the aim of the study was to analyse the electrical energy consumption of AFS on four Bavarian 
            farms (three farms for dairy cows and one for fattening bulls). Furthermore, the costs incurred should be compared with the costs of diesel when feeding with a fodder mixing wagon. 
            The results of the acquired daily electrical energy consumption show a wide range of 8.8 kWh for a semi-automated feeding system and 52.6 kWh for a fully-automated system. However, 
            with a share of 77 % of the total energy consumption the transport of fodder from the stock container to the mixer as well as mixing the rations are the greatest consumers of the 
            AFS in the observed dairy farms. A comparison of the total energy costs of feeding with an AFS and the costs incurred when feeding with a fodder mixing wagon shows that energy costs
            for feeding can be saved up to 40 € per livestock unit and year by using an AFS. The application of AFS seems to be a possible approach to handle rising energy costs and declining 
            subsidies for solar power.This research paper based on study of energy consumption for cattle feeding.Includes various energy consumption techniques.

        <h3>3.Automatic cattle feeding system</h3>
        <p>Pratiksha Karn, Nisha Somai, Sonam Ghimire, Preety Sitikhu, Saban Kumar K.C. <br> www
            In this paper, automatic cattle feeding system is introduced where food feeder follows the path through a pre-determined distance and places the feed to the cattle by the side of the
            feed fence. The prototype is developed using IR sensors interfaced with microcontroller that tracks the path to follow. The motors are interfaced to operate in either direction. A 
            sliding door operated by a DC motor is used that opens and places the feed. Unnecessary objects detection feature is also added using an ultrasonic sensor. Similarly, smartphone 
            based wireless switching feature is added for manual intervention. As the result, the developed robotic vehicle is able to track and distribute the feed in specified path and 
            distance respectively.

        <h3>4.Automatic feeding system: evaluation of energy consumption and Labour requirement in north-east italy dairy farm</h3> 
        <p>Andrea Pezzuolo, Alessandro Chiumenti, Luigi Sartori, Francesco Da Borso <br>    
            Feeding operations in dairy cow farms are of strategic importance for the economy of the farm. Aside from being strictly related to the productivity of the cows, feeding represents one 
            of the greater costs for farms, considering that more than 25 % of labour time is dedicated to this operation. Dairy farmers are increasingly evolving toward automation of their farms: 
            automatic concentrate dispensers and automatic milking systems (AMS) have been utilized for years, and several manufacturers have introduced automatic feeding systems (AFS) during the 
            past decade. The main advantage of AFS is the possibility to supply a total mixed ration (TMR) with a high frequency and a low labour requirement, whilst farms that feed with conventional 
            feeding systems (CFS) commonly supply TMR only once or twice a day and require more labour with a rigid work schedule. AFS allows for increasing the frequency of feed distribution, with a 
            consequent optimization of dry matter ingestion by the animals, and concurrently assist to maintain a higher stability of ruminal pH with significant advantages in terms of health and 
            production [6]. Furthermore, a higher frequency reduces the permanence time of feed on the manger with reduced possibility of contamination and of anomalous fermentations. Many researchers 
            have studied the consequences of the feeding frequency.Supplying roughage once or twice a day results in a feeding pattern.   
            Increasing the feeding frequency stimulates the visits to the feeding fence and leads to a more evenly distributed visiting/feeding pattern. The shift to an automated TMR feeding system requires
            expensive investments, even if a fairly wide range of models different in complexity and cost became to be available on the market. On the other hand, robots seem to require less space and power 
            than a standard tractor-pulled mixer wagon.For these reasons, the present research was focused on the monitoring of a dairy farm, located in the Veneto Region of Italy, with a herd of 90 lactating 
            cows, during the transition from the conventional feeding systems (CFS), represented by a tractor-operated mixing wagon, to the automatic feeding systems (AFS) equipped with stationary feeding hoppers, 
            a mixing unit and distribution wagon operating on rail.

        <h3>5.Automatic vs. Conventional feeding systems in  Robotics milking  dairy farms: a survey in the netherlands</h3>
        <p>Carlo Bisaglia , Zacharie Belle , Gijsbert van den Berg , Johanna C.A.M. Pompe<br>
            Automatic feeding (AF) systems for totally or partially mixed rations (TMR or PMR) are expected to reduce labour demand and stimulate cows’ activity promoting visits to both the feeding devices and the 
            automatic milking (AM) system. AF’s have recently been introduced in commercial dairy farms and little experience is available. Objective of this paper was to identify differences in the lay-out of the 
            barns and operation of the feeding systems between early adopters of automatic feeding systems (AF) as compared to farmers with conventional feeding systems.  
            (CF). We surveyed 22 dairy farms in the Netherlands that were all using automatic milking systems. 54.5% of these farms fed their milking cows with an AF system while 45.5% used a conventional feeding 
            system. The herd sizes were similar for the two groups of AF and CF farms as were the milk production while the number of cow groups was higher in the AF farms. The feeding alleys in the AF farms were 
            narrower (2.7 m) compared to those in the CF ones (5.3 m), while the average number of cows per feeding place was similar (1.0 for the AF farms compared with 0.9 for the CF).
